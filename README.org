* Description
Simplifies elisp debugging and testing.

Usage example: take a look on how it is used in [[https://github.com/chalaev/cloud/blob/master/testing.org][testing cloud project]]:
=(require 'el-debug)= rewrites =defun= so that we get a log message every time we enter or leave a function,
see [[https://github.com/chalaev/cloud/blob/master/tests/meso.log][meso.log]] as an example.

Other macros used for debugging in [[https://github.com/chalaev/cloud][cloud project]]: [[https://github.com/chalaev/cloud/blob/master/cloud.org][cloud.org]] and [[https://github.com/chalaev/cloud/blob/master/testing.org][testing.org]]:
=debug-set=, =set-list=, and =debug-log-var=.

* Prerequisites
We need [[https://github.com/chalaev/lisp-goodies][lisp-goodies]]: [[https://github.com/chalaev/lisp-goodies/blob/master/packaged/start.el][start.el]] (used by [[file:Makefile][Makefile]]), and [[https://github.com/chalaev/lisp-goodies/blob/master/packaged/shalaev.el][shalaev.el]] for logging.

* Quick start
1. =mkdir ~/.emacs.d/local-packages/=.
2. Place [[https://github.com/chalaev/lisp-goodies/blob/master/packaged/shalaev.el][shalaev.el]] and [[file:packaged/el-debug.el][el-debug.el]] to =~/.emacs.d/local-packages/=
3. Load [[https://github.com/chalaev/lisp-goodies/blob/master/packaged/start.el][start.el]] in your [[https://github.com/chalaev/lisp-goodies/blob/master/generated/dot.emacs][~/.emacs]]
4. Insert in your text code:
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
   (require 'el-debug)
   #+END_SRC
   similarly to [[https://github.com/chalaev/cloud/blob/master/testing.org][this example]].
